# Mini Data-to-Research Platform (Mini-DTR)

Small prototype showing core features requested by research teams:

- FastAPI backend: file upload, statistics, plotting, ML train & predict.
- Data saved under `data/` for reproducibility.
- Simple React frontend to upload and fetch stats.
- Docker + docker-compose for local dev.
- Unit tests with pytest.

## Quick start (local, dev)

1. Create & activate venv (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
